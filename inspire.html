        		This leader brought attention towards the following statements. 
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Fought for abolition</li>
        		<li>The rights of labor for women</li>
        		<li>Equal pay for equal work</li>
        		<li>Delivered speeches to bring attention about women's suffrage </li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		In the past, women had roughly no rights for themselves and their lifestyle. They were often overlooked as wives and caretakers. After speaking of these issues, Susan B. Anthony was later crowned president of the National Women Suffrage Association from 1892-1900 to speak about the women's suffrage movement.
